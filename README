                                  jvm

This is the implementation of a simple Java Virtual Machine.  This is
the final project of the first semester of 2021 of the System Software
course of the Computer Science department of the University of Brasilia.

The following tools are implemented:
• javap(1): Disassembles one or more class files.
• java(1):  Launches a Java application.


§ Files

• util.[ch]:    miscellaneous routines
• class.[ch]:   routines and definitions related to class structure
• native.[ch]:  routines and definitions related to native code
• memory.[ch]:  routines and definitions related to JRE memory
• file.[ch]:    routines to read and free .class files
• javap.c:      .class file disassembler
• java.c:       .class file interpreter
• tests/*:      collection of simple .java files for testing the jvm


§ Running

To build the jvm, run the following command.  This will create the
executable file ./java for the jvm.

	make java

To build the disassembler, run the following command.  This will create
the executable file ./javap for the disassembler.

	make javap

To test the disassembler, run make on one of the test files with its
suffix replaced with "p".  For example, to test the disassembler on
the test class tests/HelloWorld.class, run the following command.

	make tests/HelloWorld.p

To test the disassembler on all test classes, run the following command.

	make testp

To test the jvm, run make on one of the test files with its suffix
replaced with "j".  For example, to test the jvm on the test class
tests/HelloWorld.class, run the following command.

	make tests/HelloWorld.j

To test the jvm on all test classes, run the following command.

	make testj
