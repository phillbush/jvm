                                  jvm

This is the implementation of a simple Java Virtual Machine.  This is
the final project of the first semester of 2021 of the System Software
course of the Computer Science department of the University of Brasilia.

The following tools are implemented:
• javap(1): Disassembles one or more class files.
• java(1):  Launches a Java application.


§ Files

• util.[ch]:    miscellaneous routines
• class.[ch]:   routines and definitions related to class structure
• native.[ch]:  routines and definitions related to native code
• memory.[ch]:  routines and definitions related to JRE memory
• file.[ch]:    routines to read and free .class files
• javap.c:      .class file disassembler
• java.c:       .class file interpreter
• tests/*:      collection of simple .java files for testing the jvm
